*fzf_neoyank.txt* Browse and put neoyank history with FZF

INTRODUCTION                                          *fzf-neoyank*

Allows browsing and putting any register history saved with Neoyank.

USAGE                                                 *fzf-neoyank-usage*

The |:FZFNeoyank| command opens an FZF pane with the history of the default
register. Selecting an item from the list puts it into the current buffer.

The |:FZFNeoyankSelection| command does the same thing, but replaces the visual
selection.

COMMANDS                                              *fzf-neoyank-commands*

:FZFNeoyank [register] [command]                      *:FZFNeoyank*

Opens an FZF pane with the contents of the default register. If an item is
selected, it is put into the current buffer with the default command. A custom
register can be specified by passing it as the first argument.
>
  " Look at history for the + buffer
  :FZFNeoyank +
<

A custom command (p or P) can be specified with the second argument.
>
  " Use P to put before the cursor
  :FZFNeoyank " P
<
:FZFNeoyankSelection [register] [command]             *:FZFNeoyankSelection*

Similar to the |:FZFNeoyank| command, but replaces the last visual selection.

OPTIONS                                               *fzf-neoyank-options*

                                                      *g:fzf_neoyank_register*

The default register to view with the |:FZFNeoyank| command.
Default: `"`

                                                      *g:fzf_neoyank_command*

The default command to use when selecting an entry with |:FZFNeoyank|.
Default: `p`

KEY MAPPINGS                                          *fzf-neoyank-key-mappings*

fzf-neoyank does not setup any key mappings by default. Some useful mappings
might be:
>
  nnoremap <leader>y :FZFNeoyank<cr>
  nnoremap <leader>Y :FZFNeoyank " P<cr>
  vnoremap <leader>y :FZFNeoyankSelection<cr>

These mappings set up <leader>y to put from the default register. If you are in
normal mode, it puts after the cursor. If you are in visual mode, it replaces
the selection.

It also sets up <leader>Y (uppercase) to put after the cursor in normal mode.
